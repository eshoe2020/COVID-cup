# COVID's-Cup

This is a solo drinking game for the second wave. 
A COVID-19 themed version of the party-game known as "King's Cup", "King's" or other monikers. 

## Motivation

Many of us are trapped at home, socially distancing, and drinking solo. This project makes the drinking alone FUN instead of sad. 

## Version 1.0
