# COVID's-Cup

This is a solo drinking game for the second wave. 
It is a COVID-19-themed version of the party game you may know as "King's Cup", "King's" or by other monikers. 

## Motivation

Many of us are trapped at home socially distancing, and drinking solo. This project aims to make the act of drinking alone FUN instead of sad.
