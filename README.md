# COVID's-Cup

This is a solo drinking game for the second wave. 
A COVID-19 themed version of the party game known as "King's Cup", "King's" or by other monikers. 

## Motivation

Many of us are trapped at home socially distancing, and drinking solo. This project aim to make the act of drinking alone FUN instead of sad.

## Stretch Goals/Future Goals

- The prompts work best when allowed time in-between clicks, I want to fix this and allow the user to click at any speed.
- Add animation to click so it looks like a card is being turned over.
- Add more specific ACE prompts (on aces 1+3, Aces are drawn you must keep your pinky out, on Aces 2+4, you can put your pinky down).
- Add spotify link to FIVE prompt.
- Have rotating lists of prompts, wider variety of tasks.
- Make a widescreen-friendly version.
